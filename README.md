# BrickCollection

This is a LEGOÂ® organizing app, currently available for free on the app store. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brickcollection/id1216341744?ls=1&mt=8

It was orignally called "LegoCollection" but the Apple terms wouldn't allow the word "lego" in the app name, so that's why the files are still called "LegoCollection".
